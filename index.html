 <br> <i>The 992 GT3 RS was announced in August 2022. It features a dramatically improved aerodynamic profile compared to the 992 GT3, resulting in 860 kg of downforce at 285kmh, a two-fold increase over the 991.2 GT3 RS, and 409 kg of downforce at 200kmh.[56] The rear wing features a static portion and an active portion, which can open and close automatically based on vehicle data, or manually with a button fitted to the steering wheel (inspired by Formula 1's Drag Reduction Systems (DRS)).[57]

    Its engine produces 525 PS at 8500 rpm and 465 Nm of torque at 6300 rpm. The car has a redline of 9000 rpm (same as the GT3 done by its naturally aspirated flat-six engine) The kerb weight of the car in European specification is 1450 kg, and it's capable of achieving 100 km/h in 3.2 seconds, and 200 km/h in 10.6 seconds. The top speed stated by Porsche is 296 km/h.[58]</i>
